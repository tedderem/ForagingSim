# Agent-Oriented Foraging Simulator

Simple Javascript program which simulates a foraging system made up by circles. 

Circle "creatures" seek out the red dots as a source of food to ensure survival. Eating allows the creatures to grow in size, see further, move a little quicker, and eventually asexually reproduce.

When a creature is not able to adaquately acquire food it will begin to wither (shrink and slow) until it dies off.
